# Analyzing Students' Mental Health ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š  

Does going to university in a different country affect mental health?  
In 2018, a Japanese international university conducted a study on its students, publishing findings in 2019 that were approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.  

## Key Findings  
The study revealed that:  
- International students face a higher risk of mental health challenges compared to the general population.  
- **Social connectedness** (belonging to a social group) and **acculturative stress** (stress of adapting to a new culture) are significant predictors of depression.  

## Project Overview  
Using PostgreSQL, this project explores students' data to validate these conclusions and investigates whether the length of stay is a contributing factor to mental health outcomes.  

### Dataset Description  
Below are the fields in the dataset:  

| **Field Name**  | **Description**                                            |
