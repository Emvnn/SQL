# What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a powerful programming language designed to manage and interact with data in relational databases. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including:  
- **Accessing Data**: Retrieve specific data from databases efficiently.  
- **Manipulating Data**: Insert, update, and delete records as needed.  
- **Cleaning Data**: Refine and organize data for better usability.  
- **Analyzing Data**: Perform aggregations and generate insights directly from databases.  

SQL is an essential tool for managing, transforming, and analyzing data in various industries, making it a must-have skill for data professionals.

### Database vs. Schema  

- **Database**: The main container holding all data and objects (e.g., tables, indexes, stored procedures). It represents the complete data storage system.  

- **Schema**: A logical subdivision within a database that organizes data into specific groups or purposes.  

**Key Difference**: A database is the overall system, while a schema is a way to organize data inside it.

## Key Differences

| Feature         | Structured Data        | Semi-Structured Data      | Unstructured Data      |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Schema**     | Fixed and rigid       | Flexible, self-describing | No schema             |
| **Organization** | Rows and columns      | Tags, metadata, or markers | No organization       |
| **Queryability** | Easy (e.g., SQL)      | Moderate (e.g., JSONPath)  | Difficult             |
| **Storage**     | Relational databases  | NoSQL databases, files    | Files, object storage |
| **Examples**    | SQL tables, Excel     | JSON, XML, emails        | Text, images, videos  |
