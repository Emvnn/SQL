### Database vs. Schema  

- **Database**: The main container holding all data and objects (e.g., tables, indexes, stored procedures). It represents the complete data storage system.  

- **Schema**: A logical subdivision within a database that organizes data into specific groups or purposes.  

**Key Difference**: A database is the overall system, while a schema is a way to organize data inside it.
