### **5.1 Types of Data Analytics**  
- **Descriptive Analytics:** Summarizing past data (dashboards, reports).  
- **Diagnostic Analytics:** Identifying reasons for trends and patterns.  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Using historical data to forecast future trends.  
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Suggesting actions based on data insights.  

### **5.2 Data Visualization**  
Presenting data in a visual format to aid interpretation:  
- **Line Charts** (trends over time)  
- **Bar Charts** (category comparison)  
- **Scatter Plots** (relationships between variables)  
- **Heatmaps** (pattern detection)  

### **5.3 Data Mining**  
Extracting patterns and insights from large datasets using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## **üîπ 6. Advanced Data Concepts**  

### **6.1 Big Data**  
Large-scale datasets that require specialized storage and processing. Defined by:  
- **Volume** (size)  
- **Velocity** (speed of data generation)  
- **Variety** (structured/unstructured formats)  
- **Veracity** (quality and reliability)  
- **Value** (business usefulness)  

### **6.2 Machine Learning (ML)**  
AI-based techniques that allow computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions.  

### **6.3 Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
The broader field of creating systems that can reason, learn, and make decisions autonomously.

# What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a powerful programming language designed to manage and interact with data in relational databases. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including:  
- **Accessing Data**: Retrieve specific data from databases efficiently.  
- **Manipulating Data**: Insert, update, and delete records as needed.  
- **Cleaning Data**: Refine and organize data for better usability.  
- **Analyzing Data**: Perform aggregations and generate insights directly from databases.  

SQL is an essential tool for managing, transforming, and analyzing data in various industries, making it a must-have skill for data professionals.

### Database vs. Schema  

- **Database**: The main container holding all data and objects (e.g., tables, indexes, stored procedures). It represents the complete data storage system.  

- **Schema**: A logical subdivision within a database that organizes data into specific groups or purposes.  

**Key Difference**: A database is the overall system, while a schema is a way to organize data inside it.
